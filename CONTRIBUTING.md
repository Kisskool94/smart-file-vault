### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Link any related issues in the PR description
- Update documentation as needed
- Add tests for new features

## Code Style Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to maintain code quality:

### General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow the existing code style and architecture
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
